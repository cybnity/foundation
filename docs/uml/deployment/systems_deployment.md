## PURPOSE
Presentation of the system types that are packaged and delivered by the implementation team(s), allowing their installation and operational execution on infrastructure elements.

# PACKAGED COMPONENTS
Presentation of the assembled components (as installable and operable modules), built by the software factory and packaged for installation and start on infrastructures' environment as composed systems.

# SYSTEMS
Presentation of the runnable systems which can be deployed on an infrastructure (e.g in-house, cloud and or execution distributed on mobile physical platforms).

## Containers Based Systems
Each CYBNITY module is packaged as an element according to a Container As a Service (CAS) approach, with containerization contents allowing its deployment and execution into a server infrastructure (e.g in-house, cloud) or on an independent physical hardware (e.g mobile gateway, laptop).

Several Feature modules are optionally execution deployed and executed independently, or in a group of packaged modules constituting a CYBNITY System.

## Platforms
The isolation of environments (e.g UI experience, application and micro-services), which execute the Systems, implements a Space Based Architecture (SBA) approach to organize the deployment model via an infrastructure providing technical services (e.g network service, persistence systems solution, operations monitoring, security systems).
