Presentation of the implementation view regarding each layer (e.g user interface, application, domain, infrastructure) and technical structures supporting the design models.
The version of each diagram shown in this area is the latest produced via the source file (Implementation view).

# Guidelines & Principles
Identify the guidelines and principles of implementation that are framing the implementation tactics (e.g distribution of codes, configuration via packaging model) and that help selection of implementation frameworks (e.g for dependencies injection, UI layer kit implementation, coupling of service components) according to a Domain-Driven Development approach.

## Principles
Defition of the implementation principles respected by the CYBNITY technical designer and developers.
