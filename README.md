## PURPOSE
Welcome on the CYBNITY open souce program which target to deliver a security platform efficient and flexible for each company with need to design its Information Security Management System (ISMS) and/or to operate digital systems in a secure way against the cyberthreats.
### Our Mission
We develop an open source technological defense platform to help the security teams designing and managing companiesâ€™ security solutions, create resilient digital systems with efficient responses against to cyber-threats.
### How It Works?
The CYBNITY platform makes it possible to design the strategic governance of the digital assets cybersecurity, and to pilot tactical operational protection systems guaranteeing the neutralization of security incidents.

# WHAT WE BUILD
We develop a technology, deployable as a platform (in-house, on-cloud, in hybrid environment) based on a modular architecture, that support security activities performed by security teams (e.g CISO, ISSO, Risk Executive, RSSI...) with easy implementation of standard (e.g NIST, ISO/IEC 27001).
#### Modular architecture

#### Security activities supported

### Our Design Approach
Several security domains are covered by our targeted architecture model, implementing a Domain-Driven-Development approach.

#### Operational Cockpits (User Interfaces)
We capitalize experiences and best defense practices (e.g military or police systems/methods) to build tactical tools integared suite allowing dynamic build according to the deployment context of companies and/or to a risk situation in progress.

#### Applications (domain contexts)

# HOW THE PROJECT IS MANAGED
Based on several standard methods (e.g Lean UX for requirements validation, MVP for releasing, SCRUM for tasks execution, TOGAF for architecture, COBIT for project's resources governance, and of course, NIST for project's security ;) ).

#### Build Process
The idea creation process implemented by the project (for definition of more relevant features to develop for enhance the solution), is based on a mix of inspirations coming from proprietary solutions available on the market (maturity level to have), standards and frameworks relevant for the companies (e.g regulation to support), problems and need meet by customers (e.g companies with digital assets, electronic solutions manufacturers) and contextual drivers (e.g countries conflicts increasing cyber-attacks).
