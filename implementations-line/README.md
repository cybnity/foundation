Presentation of the Foundation production project line dedicated to build and deliver CYBNITY specification and implementation components versions.

Feature specifications API versions (e.g interface versions) are delivered according to requirements and specification identified by MVF project line's prototyping results.

Feature implementations versions are designed and delivered as official Foundation Core implementation software.

### Sources Structure
Application implementation source codes allowing build of software components reusable for systems build.
Implementation components are built via Maven tool using a [standard Maven project structure](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html).
