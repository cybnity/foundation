# Cert-Manager
[Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) is a toolset that manages certificates and supports Letâ€™s Encrypt.

Install the Cert Manager addon into Kubernetes from [ArtifactHUB Helm chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cert-manager/cert-manager) to automate the management and issuance of TLS certificates from various issuing sources (e.g Let's Encrypt for development environment, Vault for production environment).

The Helm chart project is managed as reference chart on [GitHub project](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager).

## CRD
Installation of CustomResourceDefinition resources:

```console
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.11.1/cert-manager.crds.yaml
```

## HELM CHART
Deployment of charts from this folder with redefined default values:

```console
## Add the Jetstack Helm repository
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io

## Install the cert-manager chart release (named cert-manager-uia) with custom values.yaml deployed into the node of UI layer (labelized as user-interfaces-area)
helm install cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --create-namespace --version v1.11.1 -f ./cert-manager/values.yaml jetstack/cert-manager

## Check running pods
kubectl get pods --namespace cert-manager
```

### Clean previous/old ValidatingWebhookConfigurations
When existing ingress-nginx namespace is removed, this does not remove the validating webhook configurations.

```console
## Check is there any old webhook configuration on cluster instance
kubectl get validatingwebhookconfigurations

### Delete each one
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfigurations <NAME>

```

### Test creation of certificate resource

```console
kubectl apply -f ./cert-manager/test-resources.yaml
```

## Cert-manager Command Line Tool (cmctl)
[Install](https://cert-manager.io/docs/reference/cmctl/#installation) the command line tool of cert-manager allowing to verify the good installation of cert-manager artifacts.
