## PURPOSE
Some infrastructure technical systems are deployed by CYBNITY project as dedicated to "Build and Delivery activities" relative to CYBNITY software suite.

Each version of infrastructure is a set of components that can be see as a template of support resources which shall be installed by any company that would like:
- to develop or to extend CYBNITY software suite in an autonomous way onto their servers
- to test the CYBNITY software modules allowing to customize or to optimize their performance according to a company's needs
- to deliver configured systems, operational applications and/or support services
- to provide a production environment to final users (e.g a company's security team) in a SaaS approach or into a on-premise infrastructure

This documentation present a future integrated infrastructures version of CYBUILD (CYBNITY Build Platform) and CYDEL (CYBNITY Delivery Platform) implemented and deployed as the __CYBFAC Version 02__ (CYBNITY Factory).

See here mode detail about the [standardized software factory model](../../../docs/README.md).

# INFRASTRUCTURES
See here the model of physical resources installed by CYBNITY to support the project's modules build and delivery, with ability to install and operate technical activities (local or centralized development, test in continuous integration approach, performance evaluation, demonstration of CYBNITY software suite version to partners, and basic production for small companies).
