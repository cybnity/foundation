## PURPOSE
Some infrastructure technical systems are deployed by CYBNITY project as dedicated to "Build activities" relative to CYBNITY software suite, and can be see as a template of support resources which shall be installed by any company that would like:
- to develop or to extend CYBNITY software suite in an autonomous way onto their servers
- to test the CYBNITY software modules allowing to customize or to optimize their performance according to a company's needs
- to provide a production environment to final users (e.g a company's security team) in a SaaS approach or into a on-premise infrastructure
