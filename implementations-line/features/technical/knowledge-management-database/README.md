## PURPOSE
This types of technical features are providing optimization services supporting the search (supported by indexing capabilities) and read of several types of data (e.g application activity traces histories) which are originally managed into specific storage technologies (e.g application domains knowledge graph database; MongoDB backup of domains streams; InfluxDB event logs).
These components develop data accessibility for any extended type of usage (e.g Artificial Intelligence).

# SOFTWARE COMPONENTS

- arangodb-repository: database optimized for read operations that ensure storage of queryable informations (e.g over graph model approach) which can be quickly retrieved during application process and/or pipelined data stream capabilities (e.g by domain layer). This persistence system is responsible to store in a queryable way any type of domain information (e.g read-model projection relative to an application domain) made easily accessible to other applicative components or UI capabilities.
Some indexing capabilities can be supported by additional components (e.g Apache Solr) in real-time regarding technical logs stores to support the build and real-time refresh of data visualization systems (e.g metrics and KPI dashboard).
