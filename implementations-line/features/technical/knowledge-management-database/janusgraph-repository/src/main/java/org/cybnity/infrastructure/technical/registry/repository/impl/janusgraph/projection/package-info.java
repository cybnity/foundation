 * This package provide one or several types of read-model projection relative to a data model perimeter (e.g subdomain area supporting specific graph vertex and linked informations).
 * According to the type and the quantity of projections managed by a graph perimeter, some sub-packages can be used (e.g read for read-model projection filters dedicated to search of information into the graph; change for read-model projection modifying the graph status).
