## PURPOSE
Several validation steps are allowed onto deployed CYBNITY systems and this space is managing dedicated test module projects.

A test module have missing to be deployed additionnaly to one or several CYBNITY modules (e.g feature module containerized as an independent K8S system), with ability to make functional or technical verification relative to its behaviour.

The systems integration testing sub-project are focused on the test plans used to validate the good integration between several CYBNITY modules (and potentially technical layers) during the integration quality stage.
