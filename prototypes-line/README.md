## PURPOSE
Presentation of the Minimum Viable Feature (MVF) project line dedicated to build and deliver CYBNITY prototype versions.

Based on the accepted innovations and needs, on basic features identified by the demonstrators and/or on the technologies stack versions to validate (as Proof-Of-Concept supporting the required target architecture models), this development line is dedicated to prototyping activities with Minimum Viable Features (MVF) platform delivery.

The developed prototypes are categorized according to:
| PROTOTYPE CATEGORY | STANDARD OBJECTIVES | TYPES OF PROTOTYPE VERSION | USAGE TYPE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `TECHSTACK` |- Tests of technologies compatibility<br>- Check of requirements and technology complexity|Buildable and executable software regarding a limited scope (e.g HelloWorld sample) without functional development|Contribution to the acceptance phase (e.g step 2) of a Foundation Techstack's new technology set version|
| `MVF` |- Basic features usage and value validation<br>- Demonstration of software capabilities to collect users' feedbacks before real development|Usable software and platform prototype version including basic features which can be deployed in a isolated context without impact on current official software developed|Support Lean UX process during evaluation of new features version opportunity to develop (e.g with a partner) for demonstration and/or value evaluation before entry into the production line|
