## PURPOSE
Presentation of the Minimum Viable Feature (MVF) project line dedicated to build and deliver CYBNITY prototype versions.

Based on the accepted innovations and needs, on basic features identified by the demonstrators and/or on the technologies stack versions to validate (as Proof-Of-Concept supporting the required target architecture models), this development line is dedicated to prototyping activities with Minimum Viable Features (MVF) platform delivery.

The developed prototypes are categorized according to:
| PROTOTYPE CATEGORY | STANDARD OBJECTIVES | TYPES OF PROTOTYPE VERSION | USAGE TYPE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `CONCEPT` |- Validation of technical and/or behavioral concept|Usable screen(s) (e.g web wireframe, visual prototype with possible interactivity) and/or platform prototype version including specific scenario of test paths which is usable online without need of deployment|Support the Product and/or Solution design activities (e.g during Lean UX process or software design phase)|
| `MVF` |- Basic features usage and value validation<br>- Demonstration of software capabilities to collect users' feedbacks before real development|Usable software and platform prototype version including basic features which can be deployed in a isolated context without impact on current official software developed|Support Lean UX process during evaluation of new features version opportunity to develop (e.g with a partner) for demonstration and/or value evaluation before entry into the production line|

### Sources Structure
Prototypes source codes allow the build and delivery of specification and/or demonstration artifacts.
Prototypes are built via Maven tool using a [standard Maven project structure](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html).

# MANAGED PROTOTYPES
| PROTOTYPE NAME | TYPE | RELATED TO | PROJECT DIRECTORY | COMMENTS |
| :--- | :--: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| UI Cockpit Principles | `CONCEPT` | | |Ergonomic validation and usage testing via first UX/UI demonstrator allowing to valid hypothesis of initial CYBNITY UI structure|
