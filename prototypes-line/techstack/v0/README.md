## PURPOSE
This project space is dedicated to the prototyping of Foundation TechStack initial version.
Main goal is to validate the compatibility of technologies set assembly, their promises reality and to support the acceptance step (step 2) of the [demonstrator V0](https://github.com/cybnity/foundation-techstack/blob/0aa4d70e4b1c880e1ebec00f51ea7dd7947fee4d/demonstrators-line/demonstrator-v0/technologies-stack-analysis.md)

## TARGETED ACTIONS
- Installation of each technology according to the Foundation architecture
- Test of configuration per technology allowing their technical collaboration
- Implementation of a basic test (e.g HelloWorld) with basic source codes allowing to check the good integration between each technology
- Update of results and observations into the technology stack analysis page of Demonstrator V0
